* How to use
Put notmorg.el in your emacs path and write something like this in your init file:

: (require 'notmorg)
: (add-hook 'org-finalize-agenda-hook (lambda ()
:   (notmorg-write-file "/home/krille/org/notmorg.org" '("todo" t) "sched")))

The arguments to notmuch-write file is the filename to be written. rest is a list of tags, with optional todo-flag which decides if written headers get a TODO-prefix.

The script tries to read out dates from the body of the matched mails, and schedule them if they are in the feature.

To add new regexps to this you can add functions to the list notmorg-date-extractors.
These functions should take the text as input and produce nil or a emacs timestamp, for example 

: (encode-time 0 0 0 day month year)
